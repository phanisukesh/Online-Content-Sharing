discrete -----numbers
continuous-----decimals


Nominal----categories  (names)
Ordinal----can be ranked/ordered but not measured
Interval scale----intervals are meaningful but not ratios(temperature)
              Magnitude is same(b/w intervals)
Ratio scale---ratios are meaningful(sales of product)


MEASURES OF CENTRAL TENDENCY
mean==average
median
mode

MEASURES OF VARIATION
           2     n     _ 2   _
varaince  s=  1  E  (x-x)    x is mean
             n-1 i=1  i
                            2
variance=(standard deviation) 

standard deviation s=  _____________
                      /   n     _ 2
                     / 1  E  (x-x)
                   _/ n-1 i=1


range----(max value-min value)

VISUALIZATION TECHNIQUES
Bar chart  (find frequency of value)

Pareto chart  (find 20 conditions that causes 80 % confusion)

Box Plot (displays the prominent quartiles along with  outliers in data)

Histogram (how many observations take the value within a certain interval) 

Skewness                     kurtosis
measure of assymety     measure of peakness
in distribution          in the distribution

Scatter Plot (observes relationship b/w variables)

Correlation  (measures association and direction of relationship b/w variables)
    -1           0               1
 high           low           high 
negative     correlation      positive 
correlation                 correlation

for both neg &pos
0.1-0.3      0.4-0.7        0.8-1.0
weak        moderate       strong
	 

MISSING VALUE IMPUTATION
   treatment
   1)drop observation
   2)mean imputation
   3)median imputation
   4)statistical(regreesion)imputation
